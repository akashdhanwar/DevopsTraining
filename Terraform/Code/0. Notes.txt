Why Terraform               -   We can write IaC
                                Infra as a code can be created anywhere on any provider like AWS
                                Cloud formation can be done only on specific provider like AWS
Terraform vs Ansible        -   Ansible is for purely Configuration management and Terraform for Infrastructure as a Code
                                Single code can create infra and single can delete infra in Terraform. But for Ansible we have to write another file for deletion
When to use what            -   Terraform used where there is no infra and we have to design infra
                                Create Infra like VMs and connection configuration like private or public by Terraform
                                For configuration inside infra like application deploy into it, this is done by Ansible, Chef Puppet
