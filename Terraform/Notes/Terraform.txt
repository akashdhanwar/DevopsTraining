Terraform is a DevOps tool for Infrastructure as a code(IaC)

IaC - We can write codify entire provisioning process like db, network, storage or application config

Large shell script are converted into simple terraform code

IaC tools - Configuration Management    -   Ansible, Puppet, SaltStack  -   Used to install and manage software on existing resources
                                                                            Maintains Standard code
                                                                            Version Control repository
                                                                            Idempotent - run code multiple times and made necessary changes to bring env in defined stage
            Server Templating           -   Docker, Packer, Vagrant     -   Used to create custom image of VM or container
                                                                            Pre installed Software and Dependencies
                                                                            Virtual Machine or Docker Images
                                                                            Immutable Infrastructure - Once container deployed, it remains running. Image is updated through new instance
            Provisioning tools          -   Terraform, Cloud Formation  -   Deploy Immutable Infrastructure resources
                                                                            Servers, Databases, Network components, etc
                                                                            Multiple Providers


Terraform is a IaC Provisioning tool developed by HashiCorp
Deploy Infrastructure across multiple platforms including private and public cloud like AWS, Azure through Providers
Providers help terraform help manage third party platform through third party API's
Provider enable terraform to manage cloud platforms like AWS, Azure an well a network Infrastructure as well as Monitoring and Data Monitoring tool as well as Database as well as Version Control like git
Terraform uses Hcl(HashiCorp Configuration Language) language with .tf file extension
