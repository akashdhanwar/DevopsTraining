STEPS -

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads
Windows -
    Download and Extract. Open cmd in that place and run ".\terraform --help"
    Set the path to environment variables and check "terraform --help"
    Install VS Code and Add HashiCorp Terraform plugin
Linux -
    Go to downloads and "unzip terraformFileName", go inside folder and ".\terraform --help"
    "echo $PATH" where binary are stored
    "which touch" tells where the binary file of touch command is
    "export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)" set the current path to environment
    "cd /tmp", "terraform --help" wil not work here
    So "sudo cp terraformFile /usr/local/bin", This will run everywhere
